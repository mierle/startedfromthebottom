			<h2>Aubrey is cast in a Canadian teen drama dealing with real Canadian teen issues</h2>
			<p>
				When he was 15, Aubrey met a nice man who volunteered to help him get into acting. This meeting led to Aubrey playing a role on the hit Canadian Series "Degrassi: The Next Generation". He played the role of a basketball star who was physically disabled after being shot by a classmate. The character was named "<a href="http://degrassi.wikia.com/wiki/Jimmy_Brooks">Jimmy Brooks</a>". He appeared on a total of 138 episodes.
			</p>
			<p>
				The original <a href="http://degrassi.wikia.com/wiki/Degrassi_Junior_High">Degrassi Junior High</a> series aired in 1987 on CBC and was one of the first television series to deal with hard issues such as homophobia, homosexuality, AIDS, drug addiction, teen pregnancy, violence, racism and eating disorders (to name a few). The original series has also been our go-to reference for incredible 80's teen fashion.
