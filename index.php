Adored by his mother, Sandi Graham, and his father, Dennis Graham, Aubrey charms and delights those around him. Before long, he grows into an unquestionably adorable child who is blessed with an impeccable fashion sense, a big heart and a warm smile. 
                <br><br>Though he was undoubtedly bright, young Aubrey could never have imagined the number of lives he would touch with his voice and his art.

                <h2>Aubrey and mother move<br> into modest rental property in Forest Hill</h2>
                <p>
                    At five years old, Aubrey's parents divorce and he is raised on Weston Road until he and his mother move to the affluent Forest Hill area of Toronto. Contrary to popular belief, he lives in only half of a modest house. "It was not big, it was not luxurious. It was what we could afford."
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    "It was cool for me, you know, cause everybody used to be like 'Oh man, you're the furthest thing from hood.'"
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    It's evident that the Forest Hill neighbourhood deeply affected Aubrey&#8212;his manners, his politeness, but particularly his sense of interior design. Drake seems to favour a mix of Traditional, Arts and Crafts and English Country d&eacute;cor (with Tuscan leather accents, of course). These styles are also generally favoured among affluent women in their 60s.

This video documents Drake getting re-bar mitzvahed and features Lil Wayne, OB O'Brien (Drake's friend from Hamilton), Birdman and Trey Songz. Director X describes the shoot as "bat-shit crazy."

                <p>
                    On the hit Canadian series, Degrassi: The Next Generation, Aubrey plays the role of Jimmy Brooks (a.k.a <a href="http://degrassi.wikia.com/wiki/Jimmy_Brooks" target="_blank"> Wheelchair Jimmy</a>), a basketball star who was physically disabled after being shot by a classmate. He appears in a total of 138 episodes.

                    The original <a href="http://degrassi.wikia.com/wiki/Degrassi_Junior_High">Degrassi Junior High</a> series aired in 1987 on CBC and was one of the first television series to deal with hard-hitting issues such as homophobia, AIDS, drug addiction, teen pregnancy, violence, racism and eating disorders (to name a few). The series also left an indelible mark on '80s teen fashion.

                   Room for Improvement, Aubrey's first mixtape, was self-released in 2006. It features rap artists Trey Songz and Lupe Fiasco. Drake (quite honestly) describes the album as "pretty straightforward, radio friendly, [with] not much content to it."

But something seemed different today. He finds his dressing room locked and a new, younger generation of actors auditioning for the show. Aubrey had been fired. He now focuses on his music career.

                    In 2009, Drake's newest mixtape, The Ladies Love Drake, goes up for sale on iTunes by a label called 'Canadian Money Entertainment'. It would have debuted at #101 on the Billboard 200 had it been an official release. But it wasn't. Drake's manager at the time referred to the release as "...a straight bootleg, a scandal."

                    Or does he? In May 2009, Drake appears on Hot97. Shortly after, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uKSeyYFGRo#t=39" target="_blank">video footage is released</a> that raises the question that it's possible Drake was reading off his BlackBerry. Who knows though, maybe he was just checking his email on-air.

                <p>
                    On June 29, 2009, Aubrey signs a deal with Young Money Records and Cash Money with distribution from Universal Republic. It was "one of the biggest bidding wars ever", apparently. As part of the deal, Drake reportedly receives $2 million upfront and retains full ownership of his masters. He only pays 25% of his sales to his label as a distribution fee, which is basically all they get.

Johnny got a behind the scenes glimpse into how Drake makes his music and scored some sage advice from Drake on how to deal with being exceedingly rich and famous. Johnny now has an OVO tattoo on the wrist of his throwing arm so that he can look at it and think of Drake with every perfect pass he makes.

Even though Binbrook recently enjoyed the opening of a Tim Hortons restaurant and FreshCo Supermarket, this was still very exciting for the quiet town.
